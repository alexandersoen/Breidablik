Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

See the installation instructions in the ``README`` of the repository: https://github.com/ellawang44/Breidablik

Examples
--------

For a script including all the examples, see ``all_examples.py`` under https://zenodo.org/records/10428804; you will need to download ``example_spec.txt`` under the same link for this script to work.

Note that all wavelengths are vacuum wavelengths. There is numerical noise at the level of 1e-7 in the spectra, which is visible at extremely low abundances, this should not affect results.
